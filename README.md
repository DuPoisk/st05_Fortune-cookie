## ðŸš€ TECHNOLOGIES

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript
- Git and Github

## ðŸ’» PROJECT

This project allows you to get an online fortune cookie! Isn't that cool?! First you have to click on the cookie and after it breaks, the screen changes and the quick animation finishes, you will can read a special message to inspire and encourage you. Also for fun, c'mon! Don't worry, there is a reset button in the end, because I know you will want to try it again and again. :)

Developing this project provided me the chance to test/ practice:
  * programming using variables, functions, callbacks and switch
  * generating a random number (with JavaScript)
  * changing screens after certain event (with JavaScript)  
  * adding texts inside an element (with JavaScript)
  * adding animation as zoom and slide (with CSS)
  * manipulating a gradient backgroun (with CSS)
